geodosy: the science of measuring the earth's surface and assigning
coordinates to points on it

WGS 84: World Geodetic System 1984
IOGP: International Association of Oil and Gas Producers
EPSG: European Petroleum Survey Group


A geodosy coordinate system is called a "datum", a Latin word meaning
"a thing that is given.". The Latin plural of this word is "data", which
obviously has entered English in a big way. And in order to avoid confusion,
we need an English plural of a Latin word.

And so we say:

The International Association of Oil and Gas Producers maintains 
abd catalogs various datums. Each datum has an index called its "EPSG
number". 

Luckily for us, the Python package  pyproj handles the conversion of
earth geometry from one datum to another. We designate a datum to pyproj
by its EPSG number in string form "epsg:XXXX". Literature will more often
use the form "EPSG:XXXX".

There are two main types of datums: longitude/latitude and projected.
The shapefiles in map-data-ntad use the WGS 84 Pseudo-Mercator projection
(EPSG:3857).

plotly wants geodata in a longitude/latitude coordinate system
(e.g. EPSG:4326).
We are going to inverse-project it to longitude/latitude
(EPSG:4326).
